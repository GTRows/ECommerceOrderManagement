# ECommerceOrderManagement
This Spring Boot application manages an e-commerce system with Product, Customer, Cart, and Order entities. Customers can have carts and multiple orders. Total prices are calculated and updated. Order history with price snapshots is maintained. Stock levels are tracked, preventing orders for out-of-stock items.
